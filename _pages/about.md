## About Me

I am a first-year master's student at the [School of Software](http://www.se.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests include large language models and code summarization.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Xiaodong Gu](https://guxd.github.io/) of the LLM Lab.

Feel free to reach out to me via [Email](mailto:zengwh_cs@sjtu.edu.cn).
